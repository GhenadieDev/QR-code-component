## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox

### What I learned

How I centered the div element horizontally and vertically

```css
.card {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

This project was easy to develop and did not require special technologies or methodologies.
But as the projects become more complex, I will focus on compatibility with other browsers and on responsive design. I will most likely use technologies such as SCSS, JS, and Gulp. 
But that's for the future, but until then I'll use only HTML5 and CSS3.
